## **JavaFX Project Repository**

Welcome to the JavaFX Projects Repository, a curated collection of applications built with JavaFX. This repository is designed to serve as a resource for developers who are learning JavaFX or seeking inspiration for their own JavaFX projects. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find valuable resources and examples here.

## What is JavaFX?

JavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich internet applications that can run across a wide variety of devices. JavaFX is intended to replace Swing as the standard GUI library for Java SE, but both will be included in Java SE 8. With its rich feature set, JavaFX is an excellent choice for high performance, visually engaging applications.

## **Getting Started**

To run these JavaFX projects, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

Java SDK 11 or later: JavaFX was decoupled from the JDK starting with Java 11, so you'll need to download the JavaFX SDK separately from the OpenJFX website.
JavaFX SDK: Download it from OpenJFX.
Setting Up Your Environment
Download Java SDK and JavaFX SDK: Ensure that Java SDK and JavaFX SDK are installed on your computer.
Environment Variables: Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the path of your Java SDK installation.
Add JavaFX SDK to Project: When creating projects, ensure to reference the JavaFX libraries in your project’s build path.
Running a Project
To run a project using the command line:

## **Navigate to the project directory.**

Compile the source files using:
  
  javac --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -d out src/*.java

Run the application:
  
  java --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -cp out Main

Replace /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib with the actual path to the JavaFX lib folder.
